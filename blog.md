This is where I write.

You'll find short thoughts, reflections, and writeups about:

- My journey with certifications (PJPT, future ones)
- Thoughts on content I consume (YouTube videos, blogs, etc.)
- Personal observations as I learn and fail and learn again
- Reviews of tools and platforms I've tried
- Notes from CTFs or labs I completed

I donâ€™t post as an expert.  
I post as a **student sharing his path** â€” raw and unfiltered.

Stay tuned.
