# Welcome to the Hunt

I’m **0xPr3y** — an aspiring cybersecurity professional.

This site is a public log of my journey into ethical hacking, red teaming, and bug bounty — from early curiosity and mistakes to structured learning and progress.

You'll find here:

- Writeups from labs and CTFs  
- Personal tools and scripts  
- Notes from courses, certifications, and failures  
- Reflections on what I'm learning day by day

**I’m not here to show off.  
I’m here to grow — and document every step.**
