# Welcome to the Hunt

I’m **0xPr3y** — an aspiring cybersecurity professional on a path that started with curiosity, mistakes, and a hacked website.

This site is a logbook of my journey. You’ll find:

- 📚 Notes from certifications and training (like PJPT)
- 🧠 Reflections on content I've learned from
- 🧪 Tools and experiments I’ve built along the way
- 📓 Bug Bounty attempts, labs, and CTF progress
- ✍️ My own process for writing reports

> I’m not here to teach. I’m here to grow — and document every step.

Stay sharp. The hunt never ends.
