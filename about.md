# Who is 0xPr3y?

My name is **0xPr3y**, and I’m still learning.

This site is my personal log — a space to document my journey into cybersecurity.

## Where It Started

It began back in middle school.  
I wasn’t coding — just installing forums like phpBB and vBulletin.

Then one of my websites got hacked.  
That moment changed everything.

I started exploring hacking with zero structure — brute-force, SQLi, even posting defacements on **Zone-H** just to prove I did something.

Eventually, I stopped. Life moved on. I got into gaming. Years passed.

## The Return

Years later, I found **Unix Guy** on YouTube.  
He explained how to break into cybersecurity professionally — certifications, roadmaps, job roles.

That changed my mindset.  
I joined the **EJPT** path via INE, but it didn’t suit my schedule as a full-time employee — 250+ hours was too much.

So I switched to **TCM Security**, and started learning with the **PJPT** course.

I failed my first attempt.  
But I learned what I was missing: structure, and report writing.

## Now

I’m studying again, rebuilding my foundation.

My goal is to enter the cybersecurity industry as a professional — not just a student.

Bug Bounty is a passion for later.  
Right now, my focus is on learning, certifications, and job-readiness.

## What This Site Is For

This website is my **cybersecurity log** — a place to track:

- My certification progress  
- Reports from CTFs and labs  
- Any vulnerabilities I responsibly disclose (when allowed)  
- Tools I write or customize  
- Honest content: reflections, reviews, technical thoughts, and what I’m learning

I don’t share as an expert — I share as a learner.  
This site is not a brand.  
It’s a logbook.
